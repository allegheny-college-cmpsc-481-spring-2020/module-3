# CMPSC 481 - Module 3

* Point value: 250 pts. (25% of course grade)
* Assigned: 26 March 2020
* Due: Various (see below)

## Objective

For your group to learn how to choose and contribute to an open source project using development and deployment best practices.

## Goals

* To choose an appropriate project to contribute code and documentation to
* To develop high-quality software in response to a community need
* To practice various skills which may or may not be directly code development

## Good sources for finding projects

Ideally, your team might consider continuing your contributions to the same project chosen in Modules 1 and 2. However, if deciding to find new projects, the same resources may be helpful:

* [MunGell's "Awesome for Beginners" Repository](https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners)
* [Up For Grabs](https://up-for-grabs.net/)
* [GitHub Help Wanted](http://github-help-wanted.com/)
* [First Timers Only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/)

## Before contributing

The following sources provide good guides to the methods and standards of community contribution:

* [Getting Involved with Open Source Projects](https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/getting-involved-open-source-projects)
* [How to Contribute to Open Source Projects](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)

## Assignment activity and required deliverables

Unless otherwise noted, all deliverables are due by the end of class time (2:30 P.M.).

| Date            | Deliverable           | Summary                                                     |
|-----------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2 April 2020    | Progress Report       | An interim report detailing progress and challenges         | 
| 16 April 2020   | Final Technical Report| A summary of your module's work, sucesses, areas to improve |
| 16 April 2020   | End of Module Survey  | A survey of individual comments, to be shared with the group|

### Progress report (`progress.md`)

This report must meet the following criteria:

- [ ] At least 500 words
- [ ] Completed using proper document structure in Markdown
- [ ] Includes a link to the open issue thread which the team is tackling
- [ ] Includes a `Personnel` section, listing the members of your group and roles they play for the module
- [ ] Includes a `Summary` section, summarizing the project and issue selected
- [ ] Includes a `Tasks` section featuring sub-sections for each role's completed and outstanding tasks
- [ ] Includes a `Progress` section which estimates feasibility of achieving deadline and provides a general discussion of module progress and challenges
- [ ] At least one paragraph for each of the `Summary`, `Tasks`, and `Progress` sections

### Final Technical Report (`FTR.md`)

This report must meet the following criteria:

- [ ] At least 1000 words
- [ ] Completed using proper document structure in Markdown
- [ ] Includes a link to the Pull Request made
- [ ] Includes a `Personnel` section, listing the members of your group and roles they play for the module
- [ ] Includes a `Summary` section, summarizing the project and issue selected, including a technical description of moderate depth
- [ ] Includes an `Evaluation` section, summarizing the overall success of the project
- [ ] Includes a `Testing` section which describes how the group tested their contribution
- [ ] Includes a `Post Mortem` section in which the team reflects on process improvements or repeatable successes to take forward from the module
- [ ] At least one paragraph for each of the `Summary`, `Tasks`, and `Evaluation`, `Testing`, and `Post Mortem` sections

## Evaluation

The points you earn for each module come from a combination of:

* Issuance of a Pull Request (or similar) for a feature of non-trivial complexity
* The quality of your group's in-process and final documentation
* The overall quality of your interaction with and contribution to your chosen project
* Comments from peers and external reviewers using feedback forms

### CMPSC 481 in the Remote Age

Given the conditions in which we find ourselves at the end of this semester, we have an opportunity. While [several](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#work-_-how-often-do-developers-work-remotely) [surveys](https://buffer.com/state-of-remote-work-2019) [say](https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/flexjobs-gwa-report-remote-growth/) slightly different things, the overall trend of employees both having the chance and support to work remotely is positive. It's very likely that at least one job you hold in the future will be 50%+ remote.

While not weighted heavily in evaluation, this module will require you to use GitHub's Projects tab. When we discuss progress this module, I will refer to your "Kanban" board in the Projects section to think about how we're looking at tasks.

#### What the heck is Kanban?

It seems annoying. But, from personal/professional experience, it's _very_ useful.

![Kanban Board](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fkanbanzone.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F01%2FKanban-Zone-simple-kanban-board.jpg&f=1&nofb=1)

From Atlassian's "Agile Coach," the main tool of Kanban, the "Kanban board" is:

> an agile project management tool designed to help visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow).

There are a lot of buzzwords in the above. However, think of it as a board in this case with 3 columns: `To Do`, `In Progress`, and `Done`. (The basic GitHub template uses these columns.) It's somewhat descriptive:

| Column | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| To Do  | Work acknowledged, but not yet started |
| In Progress | Work currently being completed |
| Done | Work that is... (you get the picture) |

In essence, it allows everyone _to see_ (visualize) the pipeline (flow) of work being done.

As we move through this module, I will require use of the `Basic` template. Attempting to do all the automation that GitHub offers would take too much time, and I want to make sure we're still doing the work we've signed up to do.

## Turning in the assignment

### Writing

All reports should be turned in using Markdown files extant in the `writing` directory of this repository. As stipulated in the Syllabus [in the course-materials repository](https://github.com/allegheny-college-cmpsc-481-spring-2020/course-materials), the writer should spearhead the effort. However, this does not mean that they alone should complete it. These reports require input and contribution from the entire group.

### Surveys

This survey will be distributed to you via our course's [Slack channel](http://cmpsc-481-sp-2020.slack.com) as we near the end of the module.
